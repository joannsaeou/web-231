 	; Description: HTML with jQuery. Program intentionally has two errors
 	;
 	; The program will show an H1 and H2 and 4 p tags with a button
 	; The button, when clicked, should hide the paragraphs.
 	;
 	; One error is a syntax error - something is not typed correctly
 	; One error is more of a logic error - remember, things within the <p> tag 
 	; should be hidden when the button is clicked. If anything else is hidden,
 	; that is incorrect and needs to be fixed.
