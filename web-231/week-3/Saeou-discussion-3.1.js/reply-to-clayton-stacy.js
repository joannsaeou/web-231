/*
 first that I have caught while using the Visual Studio Code and then check again on the browser console is that on the line of  [18, 35]. there was a triple "equal sign" which makes the syntax causes an error.


so I fixed the issue by deleting the triple "equal sign === " and made it into a double equal sign "==". Once I have done that, there was a no-error in the statement.
